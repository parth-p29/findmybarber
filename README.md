# Find My Barber

## Inspiration

During the pandemic, it became increasingly difficult to find good barber shops that did not get closed down due to the lockdown. In spite of this issue, I developed Find My Barber to help solve this problem by finding good-rated and open barbers around the location a user is in.

Also, once the pandemic is over and when travelling to new cities this app can help users find barbers with ease!

NOTE: If a user does not wish to allow the app to use their location, they can just enter any city/address/region they want and find barbers around there.

## Tools

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Google Cloud Platform (Maps/Places APIs)](https://cloud.google.com/)
- [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API)

## Usage

Due to cost issues, the app is shut down for now but to use it for yourself it is pretty simple:

- Git clone this repo onto your computer
- run the following to install all dependencies:

        npm install

- Get an API key from the Google Cloud Platform and place it into these areas:

        const apiKey = 'YOUR API KEY' //src/components/map/map.js
